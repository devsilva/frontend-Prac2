## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow


### What I learned


I used float initially until i was told flexbox is better in handling it so i changed to flexbox.
ALthough it was a stryglle starting from the desktop version to mobile but i figured it out





### Continued development

I want to improve my skill in building complex templates while also gaining more knowledge in Javascript
